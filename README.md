abstract
==

abstract in OOP hides the internal implementation code in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency, for example if we talk about the car, what matters to us, stopping and starting the car, increasing the speed, using the brake

while applying and writing the code for these features is what we need in case other classes want to implement a Cars class
